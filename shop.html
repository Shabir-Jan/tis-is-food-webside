        <p>In academic writing, page numbers are frequently formatted as footers centered at the bottom — or "foot" — of
           <br> each page. When the page numbers of the novel you're reading are printed at the bottom of the pages, you can
          call those footers too. A footnote is different from a footer, although both come at the end of a page —
          footnotes appear less regularly, and each one is different, while a footer follows a regular pattern.</p>
