        <h1>Support Grows for Preserving Rural Grocery Stores</h1>
        <p>Preserving grocery stores has been a perennial challenge for rural communities. Small, often declining
            populations make it tough to turn a profit in an industry known for its razor-thin margins. Increased
            competition from online retailers, the onslaught of chains such as Dollar General stores, and an aging
            lineup of independent grocers have only made things tougher.</p>

            <p>In academic writing, page numbers are frequently formatted as footers centered at the bottom — or "foot" — of
               <br> each page. When the page numbers of the novel you're reading are printed at the bottom of the pages, you can
              call those footers too. A footnote is different from a footer, although both come at the end of a page —
              footnotes appear less regularly, and each one is different, while a footer follows a regular pattern.</p>
